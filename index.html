                <!-- <p>I’m an aspiring web designer who loves everything about the web. I've lived in lots of different places and have worked in lots of different jobs. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic looking websites.</p> -->
                <!-- <p>I have over 8 years of experience in the Navy and am a life-long learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p> -->
                <p>Hi, my name is Cody M Orr. I am 29 years old and a veteran of the United States Navy. I grew up in Castle Rock, Colorado and then moved at the end of the summer when I graduated, to head to bootcamp.</p>
                <p>I spent 7 years on active duty, as a Logistics Specialist. I also had the unique opportunity to be a shipboard Search and Rescue swimmer.
                    I traveled to many different countries across 4 continents and got to experience many different cultures in the process!</p>
                <p>I now serve in the US Navy Reserves as a Builder 2nd class with the Seabees. I love the military culture and being part of a team that works towards one big goal!</p>
                <p>After coming off of active duty, I struggled to figure out exactly what was next for me. One thing that caught my attention was “coding.” I saw it in movies and thought it was so crazy how people can turn a blank screen in to something absolutely stunning!</p>
                <p>I eventually found devCodeCamp and took my time really researching these coding bootcamps and seeing if it was a real thing. After about 6 months, I finally talked it over with my wife and took the plunge!</p>
                <p>I am now a full time student and have already developed entry level skills in JavaScript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Django, and React. I have also worked on individual as well as group projects to develop the teamwork skills necessary as a developer.</p>
                <p>At home, I am a husband to my wife, Mikayla who has been in my life since we were 10 years old. I am also a father to two crazy boys! We enjoy spending our time playing sports or going outdoors and really enjoying nature at national parks and local trails.</p>
                <p>Thank you for taking the time to get to know just a little about me, and I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
